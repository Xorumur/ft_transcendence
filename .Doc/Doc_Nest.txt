With the command on the documentation of Nestjs we can't install Nestjs because we don't have permissions to acces somes files

So we have to do this :
	-npm init 
	-npm i @nestjs/cli 
	-npx nest new backend

To set the port for the back wh have to go to the file src/main.ts et changer le port.

All the nest command mus tbe called like this : (we don't have nest command)
	-nps nest ....

To make communicate the front with the back we will use axios, 
there is an exemple in routes/test/+page.svelte.
