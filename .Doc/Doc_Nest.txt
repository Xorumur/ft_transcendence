To run the back you have to:
	-zero: if it's on a new session and you have nothing installed, you must do npm i to install all the dependencies.
	-first: (launch docker or ./init_doker.sh)launch the db via ./init_db.sh or make db
	-second: just make.

To set the port for the back wh have to go to the file src/main.ts et changer le port.

All the nest command mus tbe called like this : (we don't have nest command)
	-npx nest ....

To make communicate the front with the back we will use axios, 
there is an exemple in routes/test/+page.svelte:
t = await axios.get("http://localhost:4200/test"); || Will proc the GET on the route http://localhost:4200/test.
